# TTNxt
TTNxt stands for TicTac Next. It is a twist on TicTacToe. The game consists of a board with nine placeable spots up unlike TicTacToe that are in the shape of a rectangle with lines from above to below, right to left, top-left corner to the bottom-right and top-right to the bottom-left. You can place a point on every place where 2 or more lines intersect. In this version of TicTacToe you only get to place 3 peices or pawns. Once you have finished you have to move these peice to try to win. You win in the same way you do at TicTacToe. You can only move peices to spots that are directly connected to the original spot of the piece. The game ends when one player wins. I wrote this game in python using the libraries Pygame(for the visuals) and Chime(for the audio)
